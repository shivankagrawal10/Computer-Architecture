# Graph Algorithms #

## first ##
- Creates Undirected Graph, stores in Adjacency Linked List (interally implements Hash Table to get best runtime for searching)

## second ##
- Creates Directed Graph, stores in Adjacency Linked List (interally implements Hash Table to get best runtime for searching)

## third ##
- Implements a Breadth First Search on an undirected graph

## fourth ##
- Implements a Depth First Search on a Directed Graph

## fifth ##
- Applies Single-source Shortest Path approach on Directed Graph to find shortest path

## sixth ##
- Applies Dijkstra's Algorithm to find shortest path (interally applied with Priority Queue)
